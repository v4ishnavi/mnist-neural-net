# mnist-neural-net

The math of this project is inspired from this video. https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU?si=LYYNDQunep-pkBiZ 

I wanted to use the linear algebra of a neural network and implement it on my own. This project builds a neural network with 2 hidden layers, from its fundamental concepts of linear algebra. This neural network is built for identifying numbers from images in the MNIST data. I submitted this project on kaggle and got an accuracy rating of 83.88% on the testing data. 

test.csv contains the testing data. 
train.csv contains the training data. 
submission.csv contains my predicted answer for each one of the test images. This csv was checked on kaggle for accuracy. 

Update: the training and testing data are too large to upload on git. They can be found on this website: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer
